## UX

In this project, I follow the Five Planes of User Experience model invented by Jesse James Garrett.

### Five Planes of User Experience

This model aids in transforming from abstract ideas, such as creating objectives of the project and identifying the user needs, to concrete concepts, such as assembling visual elements together to produce the visual design of the idea to meet the project's objectives and users' needs.

#### The Strategy Plane

Due to a narrow passage of deadlocked countries (Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and China), Northeast India is often a forgotten region. However, they preserved a rich, unique culture and heritage, which received little or no attention from the general population and tourists. Most recently, Northeast India has slowly brought attention to local and international tourism. Still, they have been plagued with a lack of awareness about seven states of Northeast India plus one state.

The users often need to find quick and relevant information about tourism in Northeast India. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to create a website that makes it a one-stop for all relevant information regarding the region and make the website a home for users to raise awareness about potential tourism in Northeast India. Thus, this project aims to meet the business and the user's needs.

#### The Scope Plane

Based on the main objective and goals set out in the Strategy Plane, these requirements for developing the website are broken down into two categories:

##### Content requirements:
- Information about Northeast India
- Visual facts about Northeast India
- State profile
- Each state's facts

##### Functionality requirements:
- Easy navigation on the site to find the relevant information they are looking for.
Highlight the navigation where they are on the page.
- A button leads the user to visit the appropriate page for more information.
- A contact form for users to send a message.

#### The Structure Plane

The requirements outlined in the Scope Plane were then used to create a structure for the website. A site map below shows how users can navigate the website easily.
