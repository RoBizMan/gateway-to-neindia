                        <p>Every bit of Northeast India feels like magic, encompassing the best of dense
                            forests, ancient
                            monasteries, snow-capped mountains, pristine valleys, glistening lakes, and cascading
                            waterfalls.
                            This takes you one step closer to heaven. Every person who’s a traveller by heart must go on
                            a
                            Northeast trip at least once in their lifetime to unravel the secrets of Northeast India!

                        <p>Feel at home at the cleanest villages in Asia, trek on the oldest root
                            bridges, chill in the most
                            beautiful hill stations, encounter the one-horned rhinoceros, explore the numerous
                            monasteries,
                            enjoy boating in one of the river islands, and much more. Whatever your reason may be, the
                            fact
                            remains that a major part of Northeast India remains unexplored. It doesn’t matter whether
                            you’re
                            travelling solo, with friends, family, or your better half; a Northeast vacation is an
                            experience
                            which should definitely be included in every traveller’s bucket list.

                        <h1>Facts about Northeast India</h1>
                        <h3>What are seven sisters and one brother of India?</h3>
                        <p> Have you ever asked yourself that question?
                            We did, too, and it turns out that Northeast India comprises seven sister states, i.e.,
                            Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and one brother
                            state of Sikkim. Not just that, you’ll discover on your trip to Northeast India that the
                            region also comprises the Northeastern area of West Bengal, which happens to be the famous
                            Darjeeling.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What is the best time to visit Northeast India?</h3>
                        <p>Owing much to its stunning location wherein Northeast India shares its borders with the
                            neighbouring countries of Tibet, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, the whole region is
                            dominated by hills and mountains to a large extent. Due to this, the climate in Northeast
                            India generally remains cool while winters get extremely cold.
                            It is advised that travelling to Northeast regions should be avoided in the rainy season
                            from May to September-end. Hence, the best time to visit Northeast India is from November to
                            April, also the peak season for travellers. The weather is at its best at this time, making
                            it perfect for heading out and witnessing the authentic charm of the seven states.
